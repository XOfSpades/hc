# Basic Formations
## Ordering
Our experiances show that it makes sense to put weaker players to the front. A strong opponent winning against a strong fighter of us will unlikely be stopped by a weaker player afterwards. But a weaker player up front will cause an initial damage making it easier for the following troops. Additionally after each won round the caused damage is reduced. Sometimes when having several strong players it might make sense to place a strong player at the initial position as well to kick out the initial group of opponents. An alternative is to switch between weaker and stronger players having the strongest still at the end. Manchmal kann es auch Sinn machen schwache und starke Spieler im wechsel aufzustellen, wobei dennoch die st√§rksten hinten stehen sollten.

## Size of the Map
Assuming we won't have more than 20 troops it makes sense to concentrate the troops to just a few positions in case the map offers just a small amount of positions. The more positions are offered the more we should distribute. We should always focus on the positions giving the most cw-points. On bigger maps at these positions it might be okay to place several players as well.

# Positions with specific effects
## Increased magical damage
On positions giving a bonus on magical damage magicians causing areal damage or focused damage should be preferred. Usually a round is very short so any magician used as a healer should cause their effect instantly and not over a time frame of several seconds. Magicians causing damage should be preferred over archers. Also artefacts causing magical damage are useful since their effect is increased as well.
## Decreased magical damage
Avoid damage causing magicians. Prefer archers and strong tanks. Choose magicians mainly by healing and resurrection effects. But focus on physical damage.
## Increased physical damage
Also here archers and strong tanks should be preferred. Tanks with archer armor and knives get the highest bonus.
## Decreased physical damage
Tanks are mainly used for blocking purposes to protect your magicians. Important is to cause magical damage (areal damage and focused damage). In case the physical damage is reduced by 90% this magical damage is very important (otherwise a fight might end with a draw). IMPORTANT: Avoid archers!!! They have nearly no effect here!
## Decreased health
All kind or arean damage is very helpful. This includes magic wands causing areal damage, artefacts (e.g. chain lightning) and axes causing areal damage. Don't heal but resurrect!!!
## Decreased amount of fighters
### A single fighter
Use your strongest tank or archer.
### Two fighters
Either two archers or a strong tank with a matching second unit. Helpful artefacts are: Blizzard, Unpleasant Surprise
### Three to four fighters
No fix strategy. But helpful artefacts are: teleporter, Blizzard, Unpleasant Surprise
## Healing not possible
Sounds obvious, but don't use magicians which heal their troops.
## Resurrection not possible
Don't use resurrecting magicians.
## Boundaries on the trone hall
In case an upper boundary it makes sense to use that at least when we can place multiple troops there.
