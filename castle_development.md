# Castle development
## General hints
Apart from food the fastest way to earn resources required for your castle extension is via pvp (player versus player) fights. But while extending your castle there are some things one should keep in mind:

- Extending the throne room will increase the food consumption. -> It makes sense to improve the food production as soon as possible to ensure you stay efficient.
- Extending the trone room will make it harder for you to get good items for your current squat, since you are already offered items you are not ready for instead of items you currently need. Therefor wait with extending it as long as possible.
- Ensure your castle has as many inhabitants as possible to man every producing room. Extend the living room early enough! You should also ensure that your fighters have 5 stars as early as possible and try to replace inhabitants with with three stars or less as well.
- Extend your forge only so far that you are able to create items for your current squat. In case you upgrade too early, you will get a harder time to increase the strength of your troops.

## Inhabitants
As soon as you are able to train your warriors up to level 55 you should have all fighters at a potzencial of 5 stars. In case you don't have such inhabitants it makes sense that you train some in all areas. Anyway it makes sense to have all fighters with 5 starts as soon as possible, e.g. later you can have 12 fighters while traveling in the gem bay. My observation is that this also influences the skills and also the potencial of their corresponding children. So the more skills the parents have the likelier you get children having a high petencial. Also it makes sense to switch the couples from time to time. Using always the same couple seems to result in a reduced potencial.

## Troop development
Apart from good items it is important to have a good setup within your troops. If the setup of your troops fit together this squat can be more powerful that troops having even more points. There are basically three areas you should have:

- Fighters which block your opponents to defend your magicians.
- Fighters causing a huge damage, because that's the way you win a fight.
- Units which reincarnate or heal your troops to ensure your squat has a good endurance.

### Getting good items
More important than the causual treasures are the portal, the arena and forged items. Here you usually get the most important items of your troops.

#### Portal
To be successful in the portal it makes sense to find a high level you can win reliably. To be able to do as many rounds in the portal as possible you should save as many treasures containing food as possible (e.g. the facebook-trasures). Also the goblin helps you to earn more food for the portal since it collects for you during the night so the next day you already have a good bunch ready. Important: Don't waste your food for other things than portal (clan war, pvp, arena). You need the foot to gain the legendary items.

I would recommend to invest the sould into either legendary items or diamonds. The rest could be used for splinters. Don't waste them on random inhabitants or other stuff.

#### Arena
The arena is the place to be when you want to try out a new setup. An additional magician? Switch the amor? Try it out and find out how to improve your squad. Especially the statistics are a good source. The points then need to be invested wisely into better equipment. Especially before training the fighters in the training room collect as many arena points as possible, since especially after extending the training room it will become harder for you to get points. The opponents are seleted by brackets. For informations about the brackets see here: [Arena Brackets](http://ni877848-1.web12.nitrado.hosting/index.php?contf=arena_de.php)

#### The workshops
Especially the blue and violett splinters are a very important resource. Yes, the most important part of your equipment are weapons and armor, but don't underestimate rings and amulets. Personally I prefer creating magic weapons

#### Allgemeines
Before extending the baracks and the training room ensure that you already have a very good equipment. This will make your life easier later on. Generell rule: If you reach the top 3 very often it might make sense to level up.
